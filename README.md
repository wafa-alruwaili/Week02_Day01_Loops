# Week02_Day01_Loops

## Loops Lab

### For loop

- Print every number from 0 to 10

- Print every number from 10 to 0

- Print every number from 4 to -16

- Print every fifth number from 8 to 41


### The classic Fizzbuzz Program

- For every number between 1 and 100...
- If the number is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
- If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
- If the number is evenly divisible by 3 AND evenly divisible by 5, print "Fizzbuzz"

### The even/odd reporter

- Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 20. For each iteration, it will check if the current number is even or odd, and report that to the screen (e.g. "2 is even").




### Nested for loop: Multiplication table
-	Write a nested loop that print the multiplication table for number from 1-5


## BONUS:

### Fibonacci sequence:
- Write a program that prints the first 20 elements of Fibonacci sequence:

-	Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers, and the first two wlements are 0 and 1

-	it starts like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..


### While Loop

#### Odd numbers
-	Write a program that takes a number as an input, then use a while loop to print an odd numbers from 1 to the given number.

#### Factorial
- Write a program that takes a number as input, then prints the Factorial of that number.


Hint: The factorial program (symbol: !) says to multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1.
Examples:
•	4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
•	7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040
•	1! = 1
